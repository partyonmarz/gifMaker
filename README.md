gifMaker by Partyonmarz

gifMaker is an image capturing tool for Touchdesigner

This is gifMaker and it is
a Touchdesigner component 
designed to help people 
create gifs using Touchdesigner.

There is a folder tab and a gif tab.

Folder Tab

You always want to start with the
folder tab first and select where
you are going to store your final
gif.  You can select a folder
and start making gifs and it will
place them in the selected folder.

If you are making a lot of different
gifs then you can create a new folder
using the new folder name to name the
folder and the create new folder button
to create the newly named folder.

Gif Tab

The Frameend tab is where you will put
how many frames (or images) you want
the gif to be.  Gifname is where you 
can name the gif.  It will add numbers
to whatever name you input based on the
order of frames.  Record will then record
your gif to the selected folder.  The reset
button will reset the timeline to the start
so that you can record another gif and start over.
